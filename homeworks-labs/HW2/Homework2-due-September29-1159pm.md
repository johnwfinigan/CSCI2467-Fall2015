Solve question 3.6 in Stevens' *Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment*,
3rd edition, chapter 3. Reproduced here for your convenience:

If you open a file for read-write with the append flag, can you still `read` from anywhere
in the file using `lseek`? Can you use `lseek` to replace existing data in the file?
Write a program to verify this.

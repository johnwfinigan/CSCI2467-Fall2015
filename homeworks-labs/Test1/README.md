#Test 1 study guide

The rule is, anything you needed to solve either Homework 1 or Homework 2 is fair game.

Here's a non-exhausive list:

* [Essential C](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/EssentialC.pdf) Sections 1 and 2 and 3
    * Section 3 parts about structs are excluded.
* Stevens 3.1 through 3.8 (open, creat, close, lseek, read, write)
* `printf()`, described in `man 3 printf` and Stevens section 5.11

    man 2 open
    man 2 read
    man 2 write
    man 2 lseek
    man 2 close
    man 3 printf

**Do not** try to memorize manpages, since they will be provided to you on paper during the test.

**Do** try to be familair with the manpages, knowing the priciples of the various flags we talked about,
meanings of return values, etc.

**Do** understand what a string looks like in memory (array of bytes followed by a null terminator).

**Do** understand the difference between a pointer and a value.
